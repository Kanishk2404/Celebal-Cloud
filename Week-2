Configure IP Addresses and Unique Subnets for New Users

Address, subnets, subnet mask.

IP address -> An IP address is an address used in order to uniquely identify a device on an IP network. 
made up of 32 bits.

has 2 parts, network and host portion with the help of subnet mask. 
broken into 4 octets of 8 bits each

-> It has five classes - A , B , C, D , E. 
A  -> 1.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255 . 1 network portion , 3 host
B -> 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255  2 network portion, 2 host.
C -> 192.0.0.0 - 233.255.255.255  3 network portion, 1 host
D -> 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255
E -> 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255  

D and E are not used in daily life, they are used for r&d purpose.

# Subnet Masks
 Used to define which part of an IP address is the network and which is the host.

Example:

IP : 10.20.15.1

Subnet Mask : 255.0.0.0

Network Part : 10

Host Part : 20.15.1

# CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
 CIDR removes the class-based system.
 Uses the format: IP/prefix (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
 /24 means first 24 bits are the network portion

Special Subnets
/31 -> Used for point-to-point links (2 usable IPs, no broadcast)

/32 -> Refers to a single host (commonly used for loopback or host-specific routes

VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)
-> Lets you create subnets of different sizes within the same network
-> Helps efficiently use IP addresses based on specific needs

Practical Use Case
-> Each router interface must get an IP from a unique subnet
-> Avoid subnet overlap â€” always calculate and plan properly

# isco Recommendation (RFC1918 Private IPs)
If not using public internet, use private address ranges:

Class A -> 10.0.0.0/8

Class B -> 172.16.0.0/12

Class C -> 192.168.0.0/16
