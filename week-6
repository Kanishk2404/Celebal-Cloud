Understanding and Implementation of a Three-Tier Architecture on Azure using Virtual Machines
📌 Objective:
To understand, design, and potentially implement a Three-Tier (N-tier) application architecture using Azure Virtual Machines, focusing on Web Tier, Application Tier, and Database Tier, including inbound/outbound networking and host-level firewall rules.

🧱 Architecture Overview: Three-Tier (N-Tier)
N-tier architecture divides an application into logical layers and physical tiers. Each tier is hosted on separate Virtual Machines (VMs), enhancing scalability, security, and manageability.

Tiers Involved:
Tier	Description	Azure Implementation
Web Tier	Handles client interactions and HTTP requests.	Azure VM (IIS/Apache)
App Tier	Contains business logic and application services.	Azure VM (Node.js/.NET)
Database Tier	Stores data and manages database operations.	Azure VM (SQL Server/MySQL)

🧭 Logical and Physical Architecture
📌 Logical Layering:
Presentation Layer (Web Tier): Interfaces with users.

Business Logic Layer (App Tier): Processes application logic.

Data Layer (DB Tier): Manages data access and storage.

📌 Physical Separation:
Each layer resides in its own Azure subnet for isolation:

Subnet-WebTier

Subnet-AppTier

Subnet-DbTier

Each tier uses Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control access.

🌐 Networking Considerations
🔄 Inbound/Outbound Network Rules:
Tier	Inbound Allowed From	Outbound Allowed To
Web Tier	Internet, WAF	App Tier only
App Tier	Web Tier	DB Tier
DB Tier	App Tier only	Block all except App Tier

Use Load Balancers for each tier for high availability.

DMZ Zone (optional): Use Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs) and Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the Web Tier.

🔐 NSG Example (App Tier):

Edit
{
  "source": "Subnet-WebTier",
  "destination": "Subnet-AppTier",
  "port": "TCP 80/443",
  "action": "Allow"
}
🔥 Azure VM Host-Level Firewall
Each VM must configure host-based firewalls (Windows Firewall/iptables):

✅ Windows:
Allow only required ports (e.g., 80/443 on Web Tier, 1433 on DB Tier).

Block all others by default.

✅ Linux:
Use ufw or iptables.

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw allow from <AppTierSubnetIP> to any port 1433
sudo ufw enable
☁️ Azure Services Used
Service	Purpose
Azure Virtual Machines	Host each tier
Azure Load Balancer	Distribute traffic across VMs
Azure VNet & Subnets	Network segmentation
Azure NSGs	Access control
Azure Bastion or Jumpbox	Secure remote admin access
Azure Storage / SQL VM	Persistent data layer

🛠 Best Practices
Use VM Scale Sets for automatic scaling.

Cache semi-static data using Azure Cache for Redis.

Use Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for observability.

Place App & DB Tier behind private IPs (no direct internet access).

Use Asynchronous messaging (e.g., Azure Service Bus) between tiers when needed.

Secure the jumpbox with an NSG allowing access only from admin IPs.

✅ Use Cases for This Architecture
Migrating on-premises web apps with minimal changes.

Initial deployment when service architecture is unclear.

Applications requiring tight control over infrastructure.

Hybrid deployments (on-prem + cloud).

Highly regulated environments.

⚖️ Pros and Cons
✅ Pros:
Portability and familiarity.

Easy to manage with a traditional skillset.

Better isolation, fault tolerance.

Azure VM supports Windows/Linux for diverse environments.

❌ Cons:
Monolithic risks (e.g., tight coupling).

Requires manual maintenance of VMs.

Slightly higher latency due to inter-tier communication.

Harder to scale and release features independently if not well modularized.

🔒 Security Enhancements
Place each tier in separate subnets for access control.

Use NSGs and Route Tables to enforce traffic flow.

Implement SQL Always On / DB replication.

Use Azure Private Link for storage or database access.

🔧 Further Enhancements
Introduce CI/CD pipelines for automation.

Use ARM/Bicep/Terraform for infra-as-code deployment.

Migrate some services to PaaS (e.g., Azure SQL, App Service) where feasible.

Monitor cost vs performance and shift to containerized workloads (AKS) if scaling becomes difficult.
