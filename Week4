Azure Virtual Network (VNet) - R&D Document

Objective

To delve into the fundamental components and features of Azure Virtual Network (VNet), learn about CIDR ranges, subnets, peering, routing, and integrate Azure services. Also, deploy a use case including VM deployment across subnets and VNet peering.

1. Introduction to Azure Virtual Network

A Virtual Network (VNet) is the basic building block of your own network within Azure. It allows Azure resources like Virtual Machines (VMs), databases, and services to communicate securely with one another, on-premises networks, and the internet.

Key Features:

Logical isolation

Custom IP address ranges (CIDR)

Subnet segmentation

Secure inbound and outbound communication

Integration with Azure services

2. CIDR Ranges and Subnetting

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

CIDR notation specifies the extent of an address range. For instance:

10.0.0.0/16: Supports 65,536 IP addresses

10.0.1.0/24: Supports 256 IP addresses

Subnetting

Subnets assist in dividing a VNet into smaller, manageable segments.
Example:

VNet Address Space: 10.0.0.0/16

Subnet-Windows: 10.0.1.0/24

Subnet-Linux: 10.0.2.0/24

3. VNet Peering

VNet peering interconnects two VNets and allows traffic to pass privately between them.

Types of Peering

Type

Description

Intra-region

Between VNets in the same Azure region

Global Peering

Between VNets in different Azure regions

Advantages:

Low latency, high-speed communication

No public IPs are required

Supports resource access and routing across VNets

4. Network Routing in Azure

Azure performs default system routing by itself. You may override it by using:

Custom Route Tables

Create custom routes to manage traffic flow

Map them to particular subnets

Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)

Deployed in hybrid networks

Emit on-premises routes into Azure

5. Secure Network Traffic

Network Security Groups (NSGs)

Manage inbound and outbound traffic with rules

Specify source/destination, protocol, port, and direction

Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs)

Custom VM-based appliances that perform as firewalls, routers, or proxies

Examples: Palo Alto, Fortinet, Barracuda

6. Hybrid Connectivity Options

Point-to-Site VPN

It connects a single client machine to Azure VNet

Good for remote employees

Site-to-Site VPN

It connects on-premises networks entirely to Azure

Secure and encrypted through VPN Gateway

Azure ExpressRoute

Private and dedicated link to Azure

Provides high bandwidth and low latency

Good for production workloads

7. Integration with Azure Services

Method

Description

Private Link

Private access to a specific Azure service instance

Service Endpoints

Extend VNet to Azure services through public IPs, secure with VNet identity

Dedicated Instances

Run services completely within VNet for maximum isolation and control

8. VNet Availability and Limits

VNets and subnets cover all Availability Zones in a region.

No requirement to split them per zone.

Azure has soft limits on resources, which can be raised.

9. Pricing

Azure Virtual Network is no-cost.

Fees apply to:

VPN Gateways

Public IPs

Data transfer

Network appliances

10. Use Case Summary

Scenario

VNet-1: 10.0.0.0/16

Subnet-Windows: 10.0.1.0/24

Subnet-Linux: 10.0.2.0/24

VNet-2: 10.1.0.0/16

Subnet-VM2: 10.1.1.0/24

Peering: Bidirectional between VNet-1 and VNet-2

VMs:

Windows VM in Subnet-Windows

Linux VM in Subnet-Linux

Additional VM in VNet-2

Goal: All VMs can ping each other

Configuration Checklist

Create VNets and subnets

Deploy VMs in each subnet

Enable ICMP via NSGs

Peer both VNets with traffic forwarding
