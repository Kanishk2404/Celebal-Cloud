OSI MODEL -> adopted by iso as internation standard in 1984. shows how computers within a network communicate
1) physical layer
2) data link layer
3) network layer
4) transport layer
5) session layer
6) presentation layer
7) application layer

1) Physical layer -> conveys the bitstream, provides the harware means of sending and receiving data on a carrier including cables, cards
Fast Ethernet, RS232, and ATM are protocols with physical layer components.

2) Data link layer -> divided into 2 parts

a) MAC layer -> controls how a computer on the network gains access to the data and permission to transmit it.
b) LLC layer -> controls frame synchronization, flow control, and error checking.

packages Bits of information into data frames to be sent to the physical layer.
data frame is the protocol data unit, or PDU of the data link layer and represents a group of information

3) Network layer -> manages the routing of the data. 
manages the mapping between addresses, forwarding packets of data to and from IP addresses
uses network layer protocols to create logical paths known as virtual circuits.

4) Transport layer -> 
transfer of data across network connetions, or hosts
manages flow control. It sends data at a rate that matches the connection speed of the receiving device, also carries out error control

5) Session Layer ->
handles connections between different devices in the network.
responsible for opening sessions, ensuring they remain open and functional while data is being transferred, and closing them when communication ends.

6) Presentation layer->>
handles “syntax processing” – in other words, it converts data from one format to another.

7) Application layer-> 
The application layer provides networking processes to the end-user
sends data to, and receives data from, the presentation layer.

TCP/IP -> created in the 1970s by the Defense Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA) 

1) Network access -> physical layer, data link layer
2) Internet layer
3) Transport layer
4) Appliation layer -> session, management, application

TCP/IP model is used generally in the industry, as OSI model is for prescribing a more detailed way how the things work.

TCP V/S UDP

TCP -> transmission control protocol, onnection oriented, once a connection is established, data can be sent bidirectional.
a) suited for applications that require high reliability, and transmission time is relatively less critical.
b)  HTTP, HTTPs, FTP, SMTP, Telnet	
c) TCP rearranges data packets in the order specified.
d) slower than UDP.
e) absolute guarantee that the data transferred remains intact and arrives in the same order in which it was sent.
f) header size is 20 bytes


UDP -> simpler, connectionless Internet protocol. Multiple messages are sent as packets in chunks
a) suitable for applications that need fast, efficient transmission, such as games.
b) DNS, DHCP, TFTP, SNMP, RIP, VOIP
c) UDP has no inherent order as all packets are independent of each other.
d) faster because error recovery is not attempted
e) no guarantee that the messages or packets sent would reach at all
f) Header size is 8 bytes

Reasearch and Development ->

1) OSI Model: Why It Still Matters Today
Even though the OSI model was created decades ago and is mostly theoretical, it’s still really useful in today’s networking world.

A Flexible Building Block System: The OSI model breaks down network communication into separate layers. This means developers can work on one layer without messing 
up the others. Because of this modular design, it’s easier to update or add new technologies without having to rebuild everything from scratch.

Great for Learning: The OSI model is like a roadmap for understanding how networks work. It’s one of the first things IT students and professionals learn 
because it helps explain complex networking concepts in a clear, step-by-step way.

Helps Solve Network Problems: When something goes wrong with a network, the OSI model helps narrow down where the issue might be. By looking at each layer 
individually, network engineers can quickly diagnose and fix problems more efficiently.



2. TCP/IP Model: How It’s Evolved Over Time
The TCP/IP model has come a long way since it was first created, adapting to the huge growth and changing needs of the internet:

Built to Grow and Adapt: Innovations like CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) help TCP/IP manage the massive number 
of devices and networks connected today. This makes sure the internet keeps running smoothly, even as it keeps expanding.

Getting More Secure: Originally, TCP/IP wasn’t designed with security in mind. But over time, security features like TLS (Transport Layer Security) were 
added to protect data and keep communications safe from threats.

Ready for New Tech: Because the TCP/IP model is built in layers, it’s easy to add new technologies without breaking everything. 
This flexibility helps it stay relevant, even as networking technology keeps evolving.




3. TCP vs UDP: When to Use Which?
Choosing between TCP and UDP really depends on what your application needs:

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):

Reliable and Ordered: TCP makes sure your data arrives exactly as it was sent, and in the right order. That’s why it’s great for things like web browsing,
emails, and file transfers.

A Bit Slower: Because TCP checks and confirms every piece of data, it adds some overhead, which can slow things down a bit—especially if you need super-fast 
real-time data.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol):

Fast and Lightweight: UDP skips the connection setup and error-checking, so it’s much quicker. This makes it perfect for applications where speed matters 
more than perfect delivery, like online gaming or live video streaming.
