OSI MODEL -> adopted by iso as internation standard in 1984. shows how computers within a network communicate
1) physical layer
2) data link layer
3) network layer
4) transport layer
5) session layer
6) presentation layer
7) application layer

1) Physical layer -> conveys the bitstream, provides the harware means of sending and receiving data on a carrier including cables, cards
Fast Ethernet, RS232, and ATM are protocols with physical layer components.

2) Data link layer -> divided into 2 parts

a) MAC layer -> controls how a computer on the network gains access to the data and permission to transmit it.
b) LLC layer -> controls frame synchronization, flow control, and error checking.

packages Bits of information into data frames to be sent to the physical layer.
data frame is the protocol data unit, or PDU of the data link layer and represents a group of information

3) Network layer -> manages the routing of the data. 
manages the mapping between addresses, forwarding packets of data to and from IP addresses
uses network layer protocols to create logical paths known as virtual circuits.

4) Transport layer -> 
transfer of data across network connetions, or hosts
manages flow control. It sends data at a rate that matches the connection speed of the receiving device, also carries out error control

5) Session Layer ->
handles connections between different devices in the network.
responsible for opening sessions, ensuring they remain open and functional while data is being transferred, and closing them when communication ends.

6) Presentation layer->>
handles “syntax processing” – in other words, it converts data from one format to another.

7) Application layer-> 
The application layer provides networking processes to the end-user
sends data to, and receives data from, the presentation layer.
